## Create classes 
 - Classes need hp and damage. Damage going to be multiplied by a "dice roll" (import random).
 
 - Classes will also have a status affect
  1. Fire - Burn damage
  2. Ice - Freeze status affect
  3. Earth - Increased HP
  4. Lightning - High speed allowing to attack multiple times in a round.



## Dice Roll Logic
if roll dice
DAMAGE X DICE MULTIPLIER
SPEED X DICE MULTIPLIER
1 - 0.50x
2 - 1.0x
3 - 1.5x
4 - 2.0x
5 - 2.5x
6 - 3.0x

## Fonts and Fancy stuff
Someone needs to be finding cool fonts to use for the texts and emojis too.

## Levels
- Each level will get progressively harder but you should be gaining loot which can enhance your damage or hp maybe both.


## Abilities -- (check ability_descy.py for more information.)
1. Basic ability - No cooldown just a basic attack.
2. Secondary ability - 3 round cooldown 
3. Ultimate ability - You have to use different abilities 10 times before you are able to use your ultimate ability.
